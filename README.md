# About

A simple application I created during the Web Development module during Stage 2 of my time at university.

It utilises JQuery to make asynchronous requests to an online resource, with basic information related to restraurants, such as their name, address, hygiene, and rating.

It also uses a little bit of JQueryUI for some front-end features.
